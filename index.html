                <h3>First of all, i love you.</h3>
                <p>Second of all, happy birthday moon. May God bless you at every step of your life and your day will be fulfill with only joy not sorrow. I hope in this '24th' birthday of yours you'll become a better version than last year. I also pray for your health and for everything in your life; your family; your friends; your education; your dream; everything. Like the moonlight itself, may your light shines for those who around you. Ah, I almost forgot to mentioned about your sleeping schedule. God, please help. Oh one thing, I wish you can remember things as clear as the crystal (which I hesitate). My existence in your life as a partner is to support and give you unconditional love so that I would like to say that I promise you that you'll never be alone. I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate your special day with you like you did to me. I bought you some presents, I doubt you will like it because it's a little ridiculous hehehehe. And I'm sorry if it's arrive a bit out of my expectation. I only can give you those things and again, I'm sorry. I'm so glad that i met you. Trying to get sober at your birthday ya! Anyway, I have so many things to say but I'm an old-fashioned i already wrote you letters so I hope you don't get bored of my writings. Babe, I'm your biggest fan & number one supporter. Cheers for your day.
